"""Lesson 13.1 / s6: Trace it, name the cause, put it back

Summary and purpose:
Do it: the trace

HTML instruction: bash — run in the operator shell, in the kit (the trace: reads only)
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: demo_05_01_do_it
Expected observation: serving: COMMIT, gemini-3.6-flash via vertex, prompt documind-rag@v3, text-embedding-005@1, current-only off, answer cache off
events since the break: none
the trail of ~/ask131-after.json, in the order the answer was made:
  1 the answer cache         clean  cache_hit none: retrieval ran
  2 the store and its rungs  clean  vector: 20 of the pool's 20 from its own index; no fallback event
  3 the pool                 clean  20 of the 20 the ablation decided
  4 the reranker             clean  the Ranking API ordered the pool
  5 the version              OFF    acme/hr_policy_2026.md: the ledger's current since 2026-09-23T10:41 is 5560308823a6, not the golden set's 497809ffbaa6; it declares effective_from 2026-10-01
  6 the model                clean  answered from 1 citation; groundedness is make judge's
CAUSE: a version (link 5) - every link before it is clean

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
