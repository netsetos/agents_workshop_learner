"""Lesson 8.3 / s8: The audit tab: what the admin console reads, and what it misses

Summary and purpose:
The note came from you, and it should not stay in acme's corpus. make retire flags its chunks, which leave retrieval, and marks its ledger row WITHDRAWN; the object stays in the uploads bucket. Look at what stays. The findings record stays in dlp_findings until someone deletes it. The two audit events stay for five years, whatever anyone wants, which is what retention means. The withdrawal writes no audit event of its own: doc.delete is a registered action, and nothing in the kit emits it.

HTML instruction: bash — run in the operator shell, in the kit (the note withdrawn from the index)
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: demo_08_01_do_it
Expected observation: {"event": "reconcile_retired", "gcs_uri": "gs://documind-ai-YOUR-ID-uploads/acme/lesson83_vendor_note.md", ...}

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
