"""Lesson 1.1 / plan-4: Stop this local chat service

Summary and purpose:
Stop only the background process group started by this lesson, after checking its PID, command and working directory. Preserve its log and lesson evidence.

HTML instruction: Course-plan experiment — local Python/kit inspection
Category: cleanup. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: shared setup; see README
Expected observation: Compare the printed observations with this heading in README.md.

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
