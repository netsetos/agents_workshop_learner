"""Lesson 9.1 / s5: The answer cache: a candidate that remembers answers

Summary and purpose:
Do it

HTML instruction: bash — run in the operator shell, in the kit (a revision with SEMANTIC_CACHE=on and no traffic)
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: demo_04_01_do_it
Expected observation: gcloud run services update documind-api --region asia-south1 --project documind-ai-YOUR-ID --no-traffic --tag candidate \\
  --update-env-vars "^|^GENERATOR_MODEL=gemini-3.6-flash|RAG_MODEL_BASE=gemini-3.6-flash|ROUTING=off|MODEL_BACKEND=vertex|ARMOR=off|SEMANTIC_CACHE=on|..."
...
>> candidate revision: documind-api-00044-rtv (deploy/.candidate-revision - make promote moves traffic to it by name)
>> candidate: https://candidate---documind-api-NUMBER.asia-south1.run.app (no traffic; remove with gcloud run services update-traffic documind-api --remove-tags candidate)
CAND=https://candidate---documind-api-NUMBER.asia-south1.run.app

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
