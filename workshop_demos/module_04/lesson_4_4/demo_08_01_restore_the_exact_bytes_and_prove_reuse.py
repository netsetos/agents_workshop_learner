"""Lesson 4.4 / s8: Restore the exact bytes and prove reuse

Summary and purpose:
A new upload generation, the same content hash, and the worker's verified reactivation. The checksum must still match. Changing the memo, adding today's date, or replacing it with a base smoke fixture creates different bytes and does not demonstrate the same-version undo. Keep the same object name too.

HTML instruction: bash — show this upload's event, restored citation and clean plan
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: demo_07_03_the_code_that_applies_the_plan
Expected observation: Compare the printed observations with this heading in README.md.

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
