"""Lesson 4.4 / s5: Prove the document works

Summary and purpose:
Show the source ledger in the UI and the same source's evidence from the API. On the Documents page, use Refresh indexing status and find the exact lesson44_<run-id>.md row. The first upload may need time for the worker and retrieval tier to catch up. The pin is cached for about a minute; the answer's stages prove which backend actually served it.

HTML instruction: bash — upload, wait for this generation, then ask and record N
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: demo_04_02_load_the_checks_once
Expected observation: Compare the printed observations with this heading in README.md.

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
