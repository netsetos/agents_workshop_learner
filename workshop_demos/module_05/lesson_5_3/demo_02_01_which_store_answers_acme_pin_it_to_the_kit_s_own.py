"""Lesson 5.3 / s2: Before you run anything: set up the shell

Summary and purpose:
DocuMind can answer a tenant's questions from four stores: its own Vector Search index (the ANN tier), the Firestore rung beneath it, or two managed mirrors, Vertex AI RAG Engine and Vertex AI Search. make up pins acme to RAG Engine and zeta to Vertex AI Search so every store the course teaches is exercised. A managed store holds the text of every current version, but not the kit's addresses: its citations come back with ids like acme:acme_497809ff...#rag-532341da71fe, a page of null even for a PDF, and stages.retrieval_backend: rag_engine. This lesson is about the kit's own rows, so point acme at them for the duration and put the pin back at the end. Module 5 compares the four stores; Module 15 studies the mirrors.

HTML instruction: bash — run in the operator shell now, before the lesson's first step
Category: required. Read the matching README checkpoint before Run.
Prerequisites: shared setup; see README
Expected observation: acme: retrieval_backend=vector

Evidence: the active lesson session records this attempt and command output.
A completed process is not proof that every sample value matches your lane.
